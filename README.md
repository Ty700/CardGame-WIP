# CardGame-WIP
This is a side project that I am doing that is essentially a CMD line battle against AI using cards. 
This is taking inspiration from Wizard101 from Kingisle... just without the cool user interface. I know... what a bummer.

# Game
- You will first choose to pick a class (Ice, Fire, or Storm)
- Once picked, you will be thrown into a battle against 1-3 enemies.
- These enemies will be of random classes.
- You will have to defeat the enemies before the defeat you.
- You have the option of ending the game and leaving victorious, or keep going until your inevitable demise.

# Classes
- Ice: Tank. High Health. Low attacks. 
- Fire: Damage over Time. Medium Health. Medium attacks.
- Storm: Glass Cannon. High Attacks. Low Health.

# Rules
- Player will always go first.
- Player/Enemy can only play one card per round.
- Spawn in with 5 random cards, out of a class picked deck. (Each deck is different)
- Player wins if they reduce all the enemy's (or enemies') heath to 0 first.
- Enemies win if they reduce the player's health to 0 first.

# Example:
1 Player - 2 Enemies

It will go:

Player -> Enemy1 -> Enemy2 -> Round 1 Completed. 

Player -> Enemy1 -> Enemy2 -> Round 2 Completed. So on and so forth.
